> I worked 5 years in IT consulting at [Wavestone](https://wavestone.com) where I supported large companies to conduct their IT transformation in various topics (SD-WAN, IPv6, Industrial security, IoT).
> 
> I am now working at [Institut de CancÃ©rologie de Lorraine](https://www.icl-lorraine.fr/) mostly doing data integration, managing the Enterprise Service Bus, and when the time and resources allow it machine learning projects.
