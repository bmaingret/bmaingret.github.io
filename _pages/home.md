This is a personal website I started during my training in data sciences.
I am French engineer with a master in Telecommunications from INSA Lyon (2014).
After working for 5 years in IT consulting at [Wavestone](https://wavestone.com) (French consulting firm in Paris), where I supported large companies to conduct their IT transformation in various topics (SD-WAN, IPv6, Industrial security, IoT), I decided to take some time to define and realize my own data science curriculum thanks to online ressources.
